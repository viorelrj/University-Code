Units 
of
Electricity

Through 
the 
18th 
century, 
scientists 
had 
been 
fascinated 
by 
the 
properties
of 
electricity. 
Electricity 
seemed, 
at 
the 
time, 
to 
be 
a 
very 
fine 
fluid 
that 
could 
extend 
through 
ordinary 
matter 
without 
taking 
up 
any 
room.

Electricity 
did 
more 
than 
radiate 
through 
matter, 
however. 
It 
also 
produceeeeed 
important 
changes 
in 
matter. 
In 
the 
first 
years 
of 
the 
19th 
century, 
it 
was 
found 
that a current of electricity could cause different atoms or different groups of atoms to move in opposite directions through a liquid in which they were dissolved.

The 
English 
scientist 
Michael 
Faraday (1791-1867) noted in 1832 that a given quantity of electricity 
seemed to liberate the same number of atoms of a variety of different elements. In some cases, though, it liberated just half the expected number of atoms; or even, in a few cases, just a third.

Scientists began to speculate that electricity, like matter, 
might consist of tiny units. When electricity broke up a molecule, 
perhaps a unit of electricity attached itself to each atom. In that case, 
the same quantity of electricity, containing the same number of units, would liberate the same 
number of atoms.

In the case of some elements, each atom could attach 2 units of electricity to itself, or perhaps even 3. 
When that happened a given quantity of electricity would liberate only one-half, or only one-third, the usual 
number of atoms. (Thus, 18 units of electricity would liberate 18 atoms if distributed 1 
to an atom; only 9 atoms if distributed 2 to an atom; and only 6 atoms if distributed 3 to an atom.)

It was understood at the time that electricity existed in two varieties, which were called positive and 
negative. It appeared that if an atom attached a positive unit of electricity to itself it would be pulled 
in one direction through the solution by the voltage. If it attached a negative unit of electricity to itself 
it would be pulled in the other direction.

The units of electricity were a great deal more difficult to study than the atomic units of matter, 
and throughout the 19th century they remained elusive. In 1891, though, the Irish physicist George Johnstone 
Stoney (1826-1911) suggested that the supposed unit of electricity be given a name at least. He called the 
unit an “electron”.
