Samuel Jackson is a strange man. Somehow he managed to get into my C program tests! Do you think he is a bad guy? I would rather not call him so, as he helps me a whole lot on writing and testing my code (at least his name helps), so I should be very greatful to him. Samuel, if you are reading this, thanks a lot. Stay cool.
