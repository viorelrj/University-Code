# University Code

This is the repository of my code written while learning in [TUM (Technical University of Moldova)](https://utm.md/en/) at [FAF](https://utm.md/en/). The code might be piece of shit right now, but, I promise, it will get better with time. Feel free to use this code as source of inspiration for your own assignments, or understanding my current style of coding.

For any objections, recommendations, or any other things that might interest you, feel free to contact me here:
